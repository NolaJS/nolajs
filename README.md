This is an application that requests and then sorts online government college data according to user specifications.

To Do list

- add in sorting algorithms to sort by name, size, etc
- test that I'm not including colleges that don't have complete data sets (eg: missing any significant data sources, like size)
  - catalogue and organize what I'm not displaying, and then have a page dedicated to explaining why, ex calc how many
    colleges are missing data
- add in some different parameters, like 4-yr unis, how much people earn after college, racial diversity, etc.
  - especially pay attention to how complete these data are, ex if only 10 colleges that have earnings stats
    for students after college, might not be an appropriate measure.
