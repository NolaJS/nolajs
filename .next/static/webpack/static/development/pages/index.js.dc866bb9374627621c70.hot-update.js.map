I'm a full-time UI developer for a\n          financial tech company. I have a degree in Mathematics from Louisiana\n          State University, and a Masters in Business Adminstration from Tulane\n          University. I didn't start programming until my mid 20s; however, I\n          quickly fell in love with JavaScript. JavaScript is the most popular\n          programming language today, and the growth in job opportunities is a\n          reflection of the tremendous investments made yearly by various\n          fortune 500 companies. If your dream is to learn the language, get a\n          job, or master a framework, I can help!\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section className=\"serviceSection\">\n        <h2>Services</h2>\n        <div className=\"services\">\n          <div className=\"service\">\n            <h3>JavaScript</h3>\n            <p>\n              Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AirBnB and countless other companies\n              have made it clear that JavaScript is here to stay. An investment\n              in learning JavaScript can mean great job opportunities for the\n              foreseeable future. I've been working with JavaScript full-time\n              for 5 years. I've taught a variety of classes in JavaScript from\n              basic constructs to advance UI frameworks like React. The great\n              part about JavaScript is you can use to do almost anything (this\n              also happens to be one of the tricky and seemly overwhelming\n              things about the language). I can help you get started, get\n              better, or help you develop expertise in your area of interest.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"service\">\n            <h3>JavaScript Ecosystem</h3>\n            <p>\n              The JavaScript ecosystem is huge and growing everyday. Navigating\n              all of the tools and frameworks available can be exhausting.\n              Choosing the tools to get started on a project can seem\n              impossible. I can give you my experience with frameworks like\n              React, NextJS, Gatsby, Apollo, MeteorJS, ReasonML, and others. I\n              can give you a good starting place for most projects that help you\n              start focusing on developing projects rather than choosing tools.\n              I can also help you get a good setup on your computer that can\n              help significantly boost your productivity.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"service\">\n            <h3>React & React Native</h3>\n            <p>\n              Released by Facebook in 2013, React has quickly become the goto\n              front-end framework of the internet. Huge sites like facebook.com,\n              walmart.com, and airbnb.com use React to run their websites. React\n              is easy to use and can quickly produce small projects but is also\n              flexible enough for robust enterprise applications. I work with\n              React everyday, and I can show you how to master the framework to\n              produce your own web-based or mobile applications.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"service\">\n            <h3>Mentorship & Career Advice</h3>\n            <p>\n              Do want to have a career working in software development?

I've\n              worked in a variety of industries that had nothing to do with\n              software development including insurance, manufacturing, and\n              non-profits.
